# Spaceship Titanic
The spaceship Titanic is about a fictional mystery where a spaceship collides with an anomaly, resulting in the disappearance of half of the passengers on board. We aim to help rescue the crew and passengers by predicting which passengers were transported by the anomaly based on records recovered from the spaceshipâ€™s damaged computer system.
